This code implements the client and server connection in C.
The server is the host in the communication, requiring an IP address for communication with the client and a port number which will signify the channel the data will pass through.
there are many port numbers, the most popula r being port 8080(HTTP) which signfies the port number for web traffic.
so in the codes above to test in on a machine.
use the previous example to c get your public IP and host.
or for testing purposes use local host  127.0.0.1 on port 8080;.
local host is an IP you can use within a PC to communicate between sockets as long it is not mapped to another server connectiion.

Note: it is a UDP socket, what is the meaning User Datagram Protocol
there are two major protocols TCP and UDP.
the former works works to maintain credibility, the former does not work to maintain credibility.
in the first data cannot be lost as long as there is server disconnection durning communication, the latter data could be lost(but data lost could prove negligible).
The first is used for communications that require sensitive information, the second informations that are not so sensitive.
in the course for maintaining credibilty TCp loses a lil speed to UDP, so they both have thier ups and downs.
there are other protocols, but i might not visit them during the course of this journey.
